##### Content "Guidelines"

Some quick "guidelines"/pointers for content that is accepted

- We're especially interested in guides that are specific and ideally related to one civ, or a small number of unit types or technologies.
- Currently, we're not looking for casted games, while carefully analyzed games may qualify.
- Text and videos welcome!
- English Only - (For the time being. May change as Curator team expands)

###### Providing Descriptions

Some videos might have a lackluster or no description on their content.

Beastyqt & Aussie Drongo is the best example of this, as he doesn't provided much of a description on their videos.

There is no need to write a full description, but 1 sentence or 2 is very helpful.

****Example:**** [Everything You Need To Know About Trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1PziuDAYzg) - No description

    **New description:** How to optimize your trade and with which civs and on what maps trade works best
